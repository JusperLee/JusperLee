My name is Kai Li (Chinese name: 李凯). I'm a second-year master student at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Xiaolin Hu (胡晓林)](http://www.xlhu.cn/). I am also a member of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) directed by Prof. [Bo Zhang (张拨)](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1121/3552.htm) and Prof. [Jun zhu (朱军)](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I was an intern at Tencent AI Lab, mainly doing research on causal speech separation, supervised by [Yi Luo (罗艺)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OSM9xooAAAAJ&hl=en).

🤗 &nbsp; These works are open source to the best of my ability.

🤗 &nbsp; I am currently doing research on multimodal speech separation, and am interested in other speech tasks (e.g., pre-training models and neuralscience). If you would like to collaborate, please contact me. Many thanks.
